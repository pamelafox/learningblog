I generally try not to get too distracted by the code quality in <a href="http://everyday.io">everyday.io</a> and focus on user-facing quality instead, but after a while, it hurts my head knowing that my code is messy -- and makes me not want to mess with the code further. So, I spent yesterday spring cleaning my JavaScript.</p>
<p>
One of the big improvements was to take my smattering of global functions and put them in a namespace. There are a lot of ways to namespace in JS, but I opted for the module pattern described in <a href="http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/12/07/namespacing-in-javascript/">this article</a> (#3).
</p>
<p>
Here's the basic template for each module's JavaScript file -- notice how this technique lets me create functions in each module that are only used inside the module, and aren't exposed outside of it.
</p>

    var ED = ED || {};

    ED.util = (function() {

      function doSomethingPrivate() {
      }

      function doSomething() {
        doSomethingPrivate();
      }

      return {
        doSomething: doSomething
      }
    })();

<p>
I ended up with 6 JS modules used across the web and mobile (PhoneGap) version of the app.
</p>
<table>
 <tr><td><code>ED.util</code>   <td>Utility functions, app-independent
 <tr><td><code>ED.data</code>   <td>Global data constant definitions
 <tr><td><code>ED.models</code> <td>Classes representing data from the server DB
 <tr><td><code>ED.shared</code> <td>App functionality shared by web and mobile 
 <tr><td><code>ED.web</code>    <td>Web specific functionality
 <tr><td><code>ED.mobile</code> <td>Mobile specific functionality
</table>
<p>
 I could have put the first 4 of these in "shared" but I like the conceptual division, and I'm concatenating them together before serving them to the user, so it doesn't hurt to have multiple files.
</p>

<p>Now that my code is cleaner and more manageable, I can more confidently iterate on user-facing features!</p>
