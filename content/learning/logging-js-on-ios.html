<p>I've spent the last few days getting my PhoneGap app working on an 
iPhone (an app which previously worked on Android). The hardest part 
has been learning to debug in the iOS browser, so I thought I'd post 
on my findings:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>To view the output of <code>console.log</code>, you must open the XCode console. 
The iOS browser "Debug console" that most iOS debugging articles mention 
is only displayed in the standalone Safari browser, not in the WebView (where 
PhoneGap HTML lives). 
  <li>There seem to be times when <code>console.log</code> does not log the output 
(perhaps during loading?) - in that case, <code>alert()</code> always seems to 
work. 
  <li>If you log a JS object using <code>console.log</code>, it will just print 
<code>"Object"</code> by default. You must JSON stringify it to be useful. 
  <li>You can also use <a href="http://debug.phonegap.com">debug.phonegap.com</a> (hosted weinre) to view the DOM 
and JS console logs as well. 
  <li>The WebView browser silently fails on JS errors - it stops running 
the JS code and does not report the error.  To see the error, you must 
wrap the offending code in a try/catch block. 
</ul>

<p>Given all of those learnings, here is my <code>log()</code> wrapper function that I use across my 
webapp:
</p>

    function log(something) { 
        if (window.console){ 
          if (something instanceof Date) { 
            something = something.toDateString(); 
          } 
          if (isIOS() || isAndroid()) { 
            if (typeof something == 'object') { 
              something = JSON.stringify(something); 
            } 
            console.log(something); 
          } else { 
            console.log(something); 
          } 
        } 
    } 

<p>And I wrap various code blocks in try/catch, like the callback function for AJAX requests: 
</p>

    try { 
      onSuccess(processJSON(responseJSON)); 
    } catch(e) { 
      log(e); 
    } 

<p>I posted my observations in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/phonegap/browse_thread/thread/62cf653d67e015ba">PhoneGap group</a>
and the developers there made several recommendations: 1) use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geelfhphabnejjhdalkjhgipohgpdnoc">Ripple</a>,
a Chrome extension for mobile emulation 2) monkey-patch JS functions to always try-catch, as done in this <a href="https://github.com/pmuellr/log-callback-error">library</a>.
I've taken a break from iOS debugging for a few days, but I'll probably revisit debugging soon and try out their ideas.
