When I'm developing the mobile Android app, I actually have to compile the APK and upload it to my device to test if my changes work.
It's a slower process (and I don't have time for slow processes!), so I've done what I can to optimize the workflow.

2) Compile JS/CSS & Template, Copy, & Cache-Bust

3) Compile APK & Install

4) Update version numbers & release
